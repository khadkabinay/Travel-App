# Travel Planner

### This is a project that uses geoNames API,weatherbit API and pixabay API and chains them together with the promises for fetching the data that needed  to forcast future weather as well as picture of your searched destination .It takes a city as an input and it is required.If you want to search further more details ,you have to provide a departing and a returning date an well.

## Suggestions to Make My Project Stand Out!
 1. Add end date and display length of trip.
 2. Pull in an image for the country from Pixabay API when the entered location brings up no results (good for obscure localities).
